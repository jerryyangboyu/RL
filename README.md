# Studying Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains my study notes on Reinforcement Learning. I am currently studying the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. I will be adding my notes on the book as I progress through it.

> P.S. The title "Studying xxx Learning" might still sound a bit awkward. If you have a better suggestion, please let me know.

## The Plan

The following is my study plan. The dates are milestone deadlines for each task, which consist of four major components: reading, thinking, coding, and writing. Ideally, I should spend time reading the theories and thinking about why they work and the philosophy behind them. Then, I should implement the algorithm and test it on some toy problems (and ideally move forward to industrial problems in the future). Finally, I should write a blog post or note to summarize what I have learned.

- [ ] May 2024: Finish the first iteration of my experimental project: an AI agent that plays Gomoku! I will start with a simple Q-learning agent with a neural network as the Q-function approximator. My current plan is to begin with an MLP, then progress to a CNN, and ultimately explore other techniques such as decision trees.
- [ ] June 2024: Finish the first two chapters of the book "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.

## Books I am Reading

- [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. This book covers the basic concepts and philosophy of Reinforcement Learning.
- [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai) by Aston Zhang, Zachary C. Lipton, Mu Li, and Alexander J. Smola. This book serves as a practical guide and reference for implementing deep learning algorithms.

## Writing

After graduating from [UCL Computer Science](https://ucl.ac.uk/computer-science), I realized the importance of communication skills more than ever before. To enhance my skills, I decided to write notes to help me organize my thoughts and communicate with others. These notes will be published as posts in [journals](notes).

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions or corrections, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I would be happy to discuss and learn from you. You can contact me at [boyu.yang.21@alumni.ucl.ac.uk](mailto:boyu.yang.21@alumni.ucl.ac.uk), and I look forward to hearing from you.
